# LendingClub Loan Prediction

The project goal is to train a **classification model** to predict bad loans on a major lending platform, Lending Club.

Dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club?select=rejected_2007_to_2018Q4.csv.gz). 

Unfortunately, this was updated a year ago, so, it's not the most recent data.

## Project Outline
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Classification Model

## Results
CatBoost Classifier was the best model for the purpose. The accuracy of this model was .75.

Improvement could be improved by using ensemble model instead of using a single model.
